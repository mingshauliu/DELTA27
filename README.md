# DECO-DELTA 27

This is a modified version of DECO that includes a global Delta 27 (D27) symmetry. The fermions are triplets under D27 and the BSM scalar fields are anti-triplets under D27. The BSM scalars introduced are based on the [Universal Texture Zero](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.01741) (UTZ) model developed by Ivo de Medeiros Varzielas, Graham G. Ross, and Jim Talbert. The programme counts the effective Lagrangian at each dimension using DECO developed by Simon Calo, Coenraad Marinissen and Rudi Rahn. 

If you use DECO, please cite the relevant [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04395).

DECO relies on FORM, which can be found on Jos Vermaseren's [github repository](https://github.com/vermaseren/form).
